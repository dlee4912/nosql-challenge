The two files are 'NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb' and 'NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb' that work with creating and interacting with a MongoDB database. 

The setup file sets up the database and tests its functionality.

The analysis file interacts with the databse. 

The resources folder contains the data to be imported into the MongoDB.
